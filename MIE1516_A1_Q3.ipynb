        "* You do not need to implement exactly the pgmpy interface(e.g., you don’t need to specify variable cardinality), but your tool should accept the same CPD format as pgmpyto facilitate testing / grading.  \n",
        "* To test, you need to showa comparison of pgmpy matching theoutput ofyour tool with 2 Bayes nets (each having at least 5variables) and 3different queriesper Bayes net.  During grading (in lab), you will be asked to showquery results with a third Bayes netand queries we will provide.\n",
